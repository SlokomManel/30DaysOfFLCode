Paper: Federated learning: challenges, methods, and future directions

#Problem formulation:
- Aim to learn a single, global model under the constraint that device-generated data is stored and processed locally with intermediate updates being communicated periodically with a central server. 

-- The local objective function is often defined as the empirical risk over local data. 

# Core challenges: 
1- Expensive communication
